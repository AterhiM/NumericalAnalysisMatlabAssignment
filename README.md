## **Approximation of Functions - Numerical Differentiation - Numerical Integration**

This is a Numerical Analysis assignement that enables you to discover, with mathematical details and matlab code, 
3 main methods in Numerical Analysis presented in 3 problems .

These problems are defined as follows:

- **Problem 1:** In this problem, the main focus is on the approximation of a given function
using Lagrange interpolation on different itervals.

- **Problem 2:** the approximation of a derivative can be a little bit tricky, so what happens 
if we pushed the order of the approximation a little bit higher ?

- **Problem 3:** Using Three-point Gauss Quadrature formula for interating a given function over 
the interval [-1, 1].


### **What are the files in this repository ?**

In this repository, you will find 3 files for each problem. Each problem contain the following:

- Full statement of the problem.

- Matlab code for the problem.

- Mathematical answers too (if necessary).

- Code files description for each Matlab code related to which problem.
